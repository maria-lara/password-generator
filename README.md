# password-generator

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a password generator for new employees when setting up or updating their accounts for a company. The goal is to have the employee select their conditions for the password (password lenght, types of characters, etc.) and have a random password created based upon the set criteria. Therefore, the password should be much safer and not liable to having accounts being hacked. 

In this generator, you can select the password length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerical values, or special symbols. This was created using HTML, CSS, and plenty of JavaScript.
